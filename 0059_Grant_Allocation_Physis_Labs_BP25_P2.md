## Summary

This proposal seeks approval to allocate funding for **Breakpoint Objectives Phase 2**, the critical execution window leading directly into **Breakpoint UAE 2025**. Phase 2 covers final production, deployment readiness, partner integration, and on-site preparation required to present the Physis ecosystem in its complete, investor-ready state.

This phase builds upon Phase 1 (PGP58) and focuses on delivering the full Physis loop — Persona → SmartSpot → SYNCRAL → ASTRALIS — alongside polished industrial design and regulatory alignment materials.
