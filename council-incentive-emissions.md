# Council Incentive Emissions

### Introduction

In our ongoing efforts to incentivize participation and reward our DAO members, we have devised a PHY emission strategy that not only recognises the Councils contributions but also safeguards our project's liquidity. This memo outlines the proposed emission parameters for distributing PHY, incorporating a monthly balanced staggered release mechanism.

### Emission Parameters

Each DAO Council Member is entitled to receive an incentive reward of 3,000 PHY monthly. To manage and distribute these rewards effectively, while minimising potential impacts on liquidity, we propose the following structured approach:

- **Total Monthly Distribution:**

Given our current membership count of 8, the total monthly distribution will amount to 24,000 PHY (3,000 PHY per member).

# Token Distribution Schedule for Different Month Lengths

To ensure an even distribution of 3000 PHY tokens monthly to each of 8 members while minimizing liquidity impact, adjustments are made based on the month's length. This document outlines the formula and adjustments required for months with 31, 29, and 28 days.

## Given Variables

- `M = 8`: Total number of members.
- `D`: Total days in the month (31 for months with 31 days, 29 for February in leap years, and 28 for February in non-leap years).
- `i`: Member's assigned number (1 through 8).

## Distribution Day Formula

The formula to calculate the distribution day (`D_dist`) for each member is as follows:


- **Balanced Staggered Release:**

To mitigate large, instantaneous impacts on liquidity resulting from bulk releases, we will implement a balanced staggered release schedule. This approach ensures a more even distribution into the market over the course of each month.

### Implementation Strategy

- **Monthly Distribution Formula:**

Each member receives a monthly allocation of 3,000 PHY. The distribution is calculated as follows:
`Monthly PHY per Member = 3,000 PHY`

- **Staggered Release Schedule:**

The total monthly distribution is segmented into weekly or daily releases, depending on Council preference and operational feasibility. This ensures a continuous flow of PHY, reducing market pressure and aiding in liquidity preservation.

- **24-Month Emission Period:**

The emission strategy is designed to span a 24-month period, a standard Council Members term per Council Protocol, providing full-term incentives. The cumulative distribution per Council Member over this period will be 72,000 PHY, calculated as:
`Total PHY per Council Member over 24 Months = 3,000 PHY/month × 24 months`

### Benefits

- **Liquidity Management:** By spreading out emissions, we reduce the risk of significant liquidity impacts following large, simultaneous releases.
- **Council Member Incentivization:** A clear, structured reward mechanism encourages ongoing participation and contribution to the DAO.
- **Market Stability:** A staggered release helps maintain stability, benefiting both our members and the overall ecosystem.

### Conclusion

The proposed balanced staggered release strategy for PHY emissions represents a thoughtful approach to Council Member incentivization and liquidity management. By implementing this strategy, we aim to foster a healthy, sustainable economic environment for our DAO.
